               you just seems like the piece i‚Äôve been missing my whole entire life.. <br/><br/>
               the way you make me feel.. the smile you gave me.. your looks, the way i see you‚Ä¶ <br/><br/>
               those little2 things you do, it makes my heart race and never want to end the moment.. the moments i spend with you.. the way you make me happy‚Ä¶effortlessly.. just by being you‚Ä¶<br/><br/> 
               and me just lost, drowning in your eyes.. yearning to your divine beauty‚Ä¶.you just not a pale moonlight‚Ä¶. that lits the darkness with your presence‚Ä¶ bichh .. <br/><br/>
               you're the first ray of the sun to my morning‚Ä¶you're  the first soothing wind in spring.. you're the golden maple leaf in autumn‚Ä¶ and me, i‚Äôm just a person observing the seasonal changes not the nature‚Ä¶ <br/><br/>
               so i remain a mere admirer but not an element that goes along with it...my feelings for you are pure.. even though it developed in such a short time.. <br/><br/>
               it feels like ive been with you forever‚Ä¶and i want to be with you forever... till eternity... you're not the other woman bichh... you're the only woman... my only woman...<br/><br/>
               me overthink on small2 reasons‚Ä¶ but its okay .. you always there to make me feel better again‚Ä¶.. me wanna be always close to you bich‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ know you moree‚Ä¶ feel you moreeee‚Ä¶. love you even moreeeeee‚Ä¶ <br/><br/>
               me happy being with you‚Ä¶ being together.. always and forevermore‚Ä¶ me..like.. never really cared until i met you so‚Ä¶ now i have a reason to‚Ä¶ and the reason is you bichü§çü§ç me dwem proud to call you mine ‚ú®‚Ä¶thankew for coming in my life‚Ä¶ for making me smile.. <br/><br/>
               laugh‚Ä¶ happy‚Ä¶ excited‚Ä¶ me thankful god sent you‚Ä¶ and you found me‚Ä¶. if you didn't want me, you would have told me face to face that I'm not just your type and if you didn't love me, you would have already told me to pack my bags and get out of your life.. <br/><br/>
               but instead you told me not to worry i'm the one man worth your sacrifice... and these are the total signs that shows that you are mine.... it's how your body translates to me... i wanna be the one that you can rely on... the first time we met, it was the last time that I wasn't thinking about you... <br/><br/>
               ilabu bich ü§ç i can go moree and more btw.. i think i'll stop here and save it for next time... so this won't be the last.. hehe pichungg3‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
